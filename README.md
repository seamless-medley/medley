## Overview
Medley is a project that aims to deliver a genuine radio station experience with automatic, seamless playback and mixing capabilities.

Medley brings a radio-like approach to your personal music collection.

It's more than just a playlist - it's a system that creates a continuous, curated listening stream based on your preferences and music moods, with the added bonus of Discord bot functionality for interactive control.

We have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/vrzCvV2hjS) channel where anyone can join.

So you can:

- Interact with the Medley Discord bot
- Listen to the audio stream provided by Medley
- Connect with other Medley users and the development team

You can also run your own Medley instance, please see [Beta Testing Guide](https://github.com/seamless-medley/medley/wiki/Beta-Testing).

## Project Motivation

Medley was born out of a personal desire to enhance the music listening experience. My motivations stem from common frustrations and a love for diverse, engaging audio:

- **Avoiding "Music Boredom"**: Playing random songs can lead to jarring mood shifts, while sticking to playlists becomes predictable over time. Medley aims to strike a balance, offering variety without sacrificing cohesion.

- **Replicating Radio Magic**: The project draws inspiration from the curated experience of radio stations, where songs flow seamlessly from one to another, maintaining a consistent vibe.

- **Unpredictability with Purpose**: Medley seeks to recreate the excitement of not knowing what song comes next, while ensuring that each transition makes sense musically and emotionally.

- **Enhancing Interaction**: While traditional radio offers limited listener interaction, Medley incorporates features like Discord integration to allow users to engage with the audio stream, request songs, and customize their experience.

## Supported File Formats

- MP3
- FLAC
- WAV
- OGG

## Powered by [node-medley](https://github.com/seamless-medley/medley/blob/main/packages/node-medley/README.md)
Medley is powered by the `node-medley` project, which serves as the engine behind all of its audio capabilities.

For detailed information about `node-medley`, please refer to its [README](https://github.com/seamless-medley/medley/blob/main/packages/node-medley/README.md)

## [ReplayGain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReplayGain) and Audio Limiter
Medley supports ReplayGain to ensure a consistent listening experience.

- Prevents sudden volume changes between tracks, eliminating the need for manual volume adjustments
- Maintains a comfortable listening level across different songs
- Prevents audio clipping and distortion

## Customizable Seamless Mixing
Medley offers a feature that allows customization of the automatic mixing behavior for each track. This is achieved through embedded metadata in the media files:

This feature provides granular control over how the tracks blend together.

## Audio Output Targets
Medley can send its audio output to the following targets:
- Discord
- Icecast
- ... and more to come

## Running your own station
We welcome beta testers to try out the current version and provide valuable feedback.
